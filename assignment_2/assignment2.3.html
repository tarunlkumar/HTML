        <ol>

    </p>
    <h2>Prerequisites:</h2>
    <p>You will need a text editor, such as Notepad and an Internet browser, such as Internet Explorer or
        Netscape.
        <br>
        Q: What is Notepad and where do I get it?<br>
        A: Notepad is the default Windows text editor. On most Windows systems, click your Start
        button and choose Programs then Accessories. It should be a little blue notebook.
        <h3>Mac Users:</h3> SimpleText is the default text editor on the Mac. In OSX use TextEdit and change
        the following preferences: Select <span class="highlight"> (the preferences window)</span> Plain text instead of Rich text and
        then select Ignore rich text commands in HTML files. This is very important because if you don't
        do this HTML codes probably won't work.
        One thing <span class="highlight"> should avoid using is a word processor </span>(like Microsoft Word) for authoring your HTML
        documents. 
        
    </p>
    
    <h2>What is an html File?</h2>
    <p>
        HTML is a format that tells a computer how to display a web page. The documents themselves are
        plain text files with special <span class="highlight">"tags"</span> or codes that a web browser uses to interpret and display
        information on your computer screen.
