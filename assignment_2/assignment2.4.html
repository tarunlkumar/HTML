    <h2>Automobile History 101</h2>
    <p>An automobile is a self-propelled (auto) vehicle (mobile). The modern automobile design dates back 120 years to when
        gasoline-fueled engines were installed in carriages formerly pulled by horses. Soon, other components were added to make
        the ride smoother, faster, and more enjoyable for passengers. Within 25 years, more than 1 million cars and trucks were on
        the roads and the horse was nearly unemployed.

    <h2>Primary Automobile Components</h2>
    <h3>ENGINE</h3>
    <p>
        The engine in a car contains cylinders in which thousands of controlled explosions occur every minute the engine is running. The
        explosions occur when a mixture of gasoline and air is compressed and then ignited by an electric spark. The resulting explosions push the movable bottom wall of the cylinder down, which
        turns a shaft</p>

        <h3>TRANSMISSION</h3>
        <p>A transmission transmits or moves the engineâ€™s rotation power to the wheels in stages using gears. Transmission gears function similarly to the gears on a ten-speed bicycle. A manual transmission requires the driver to manually select gears, while
            an automatic transmission selects gears automatically as designed.</p>
